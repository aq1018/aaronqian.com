Thanksgiving night isn’t usually when people open KiCad… but the house got quiet
for a bit, and that was enough of an excuse for me to start a small hardware
project that’s been sitting in the queue.

This is Part 1 of a tiny reflective IR sensor system I’m building. This PCB
represents roughly half of the full sensor — the detection + comparator stage.
Part 2 will cover real-world testing once the boards arrive.
