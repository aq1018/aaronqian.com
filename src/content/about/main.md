I’m Aaron Qian, a software engineering consultant, hardware hobbyist, and
father. I learned to program young, built my first C++/DirectX game in high
school, and studied Computer Engineering to understand both the hardware and the
software that drives it. For the past 20 years I’ve partnered with founders and
small teams to turn messy ideas into stable systems.

**How I work:** Begin with goals and values, translate them into minimal
requirements, choose the simplest architecture for today only. I keep code
maintainable so iteration keeps cheap. Ship early, measure real signals, and
refactor with intent, and let progress compound.

I favor architectures that are boring in the best way: fast, observable, and
easy to reason about. A system is “done” not when there’s nothing left to add,
but when there’s nothing left to remove. I contribute to open source and
occasionally upstream fixes (including bugfixes to Ruby) because open source
matters. These days I split time between client work and late-night bench
sessions exploring embedded robotics and edge-first web stacks.

If that mix of craft, clarity, and curiosity resonates, welcome.
