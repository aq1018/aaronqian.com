I'm a developer and maker who builds web applications and hardware prototypes. I
work at the intersection of software engineering and physical computing, with a
focus on maintainable systems that solve real problems.

My approach prioritizes clarity, testing, and incremental progress. I believe
the best technical work comes from understanding both the problem domain and the
constraints—then building the simplest solution that works.
