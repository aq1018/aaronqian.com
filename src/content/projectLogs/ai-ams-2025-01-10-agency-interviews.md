Interviewed 5 agencies. Common pain points:

1. Data entry (iPipeline forms, SureLC carrier portals)
2. Follow-up scheduling (clients ghost, need reminders)
3. Commission reconciliation (manual spreadsheet hell)

Biggest opportunity: Auto-fill carrier applications from CRM data.

Agents spend ~40% of time on data entry. Even 50% reduction = huge win.

Next: Map iPipeline API, prototype auto-fill Chrome extension.
