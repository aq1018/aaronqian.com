SG90 servos can't lift the frame. Measured torque: ~1.2 kg·cm. Need ~3 kg·cm.

Ordered 12x MG90S (metal gears, 2.2 kg·cm). Slightly heavier but should work.

Also ordered:

- 7.4V LiPo (2S) for more headroom
- Step-down converter for logic (5V)

Weight budget now critical. Might need to redesign frame in FreeCAD.
