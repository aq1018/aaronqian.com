Replaced single-page form with 4-step wizard:

1. Basic info (name, age)
2. Coverage needs
3. Health screening
4. Quote preferences

Theory: smaller chunks = less intimidation = higher completion.

Deployed to 50% traffic. Monitoring conversion delta.

Current baseline: 1.2% completion. Target: 30%.
