Finally got cascaded PID stable:

- Outer loop (position): Kp=2.5, Ki=0.1, Kd=0.8
- Inner loop (velocity): Kp=1.2, Ki=0.05, Kd=0.3

Overshoot down from 15% to 2%. Settling time: 120ms.

Current sensing working. Drawing ~800mA at stall. Need heatsink for FET.

Next: Test bus comms (RS-485) with daisy-chained servos.
